These test files help ensure that the Matlab, R and Python versions of the code return consistent
results.

They originate from github.io/MannKendall/test-data. If these test files require modification for
any reason (bug fix, new test, etc ...), these changes should be made to that repository as well,
and (ideally) checked/implemented in the other code versions.
