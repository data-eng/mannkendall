Troubleshooting
---------------

1.
If you encounter errors when running mannkendall, first ensure that all the
:ref:`required packages <installation:Requirements>` are up-to-date, then try again.

2.
Check if this is one of the known open |issues|. You can also check the fixed issues
`here <https://github.com/MeteoSwiss-MDA/mannkendall/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+>`_.

3.
If you still can't figure out what's wrong, please `submit a new issue on the Github repository of
the project <https://github.com/MeteoSwiss-MDA/mannkendall/issues>`_. Provide as much detail as possible
(mannkendall version, error message, minimal example, operating system, Python version, etc ...).
