`here <https://github.com/mannkendall/Python/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+>`_.

3.
If you still can't figure out what's wrong, please `submit a new issue on the Github repository of
the project <https://github.com/mannkendall/Python/issues>`_. Provide as much detail as possible:

    * |name| version
    * error message
    * minimal example
    * operating system
    * Python version
    * ...
